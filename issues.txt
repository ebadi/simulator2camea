### Issues

- It seems that the simulator doesn't use the correct coordination for the viewpoint (loading from the json file) and moves the view point down. As an example, if you place a viewpoint to close to the ground, the simulator takes picture from under the ground!
- Interval between photo capturing is constant (probably one second)
- Total number of image, not the number of image per viewpoint
- absolute path to the scenario json is needed
- Camera setting is not applied when a veiw point is placed in the scene
- License plate are random
- No warning for saving the scenario when you press `ESC`
