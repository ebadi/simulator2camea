### Instruction

- Place the simulator (Deccq_V2.0.1.1) in the root directory.
- Place the license plate dataset in the root directory
- Adjust the absolute path to the scenario json file in the `start.bat` file
- run the bat file
- install pyhton dependencies (see `requirements.txt`) and run `detector.py`

### Issues

- It seems that the simulator doesn't use the correct coordination for the viewpoint (loading from the json file) and moves the view point down. As an example, if you place a viewpoint to close to the ground, the simulator takes picture from under the ground!
- Interval between photo capturing
- Total number of image, not the number of image per viewpoint
- absolute path to the scenario json is needed
